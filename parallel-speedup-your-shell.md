### Speed Up Your Linux Commands with `parallel`

When working on the Linux command line, many tasks are run one after another. That works fine, but it’s often slow. The [GNU `parallel` command](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) is designed to fix that. It allows you to run multiple tasks at the same time, automatically spreading them across your CPU cores. This can dramatically speed up repetitive operations and make your workflows much more efficient.

Let’s start with a simple example. Imagine you have a directory full of large log files. Normally, if you compress them with `gzip`, they’ll be processed sequentially: one file finishes, then the next begins. That can take a long time. With `parallel`, you can launch all those gzip commands simultaneously. The syntax is simple:

```bash
ls *.log | parallel gzip {}
```

Here, `ls *.log` lists the log files, and `parallel` runs `gzip` on each one in parallel. The `{}` acts as a placeholder for the filename. Instead of waiting minutes for everything to finish, you’ll see all the compressions happening together.

Now, let’s look at another common case: downloading multiple files. Normally, using `wget`, you’d run one command at a time, waiting for each file to finish before starting the next. But with `parallel`, you can start all downloads at once:

```bash
parallel wget ::: \
https://example.com/file1.zip \
https://example.com/file2.zip \
https://example.com/file3.zip
```

The `:::` tells `parallel` to treat the following items as arguments. Each URL is passed to `wget` in parallel, so instead of downloading sequentially, you use your bandwidth efficiently and get everything much faster.

These two examples show why `parallel` is so powerful. It saves time, it’s easy to use, and it integrates smoothly into existing shell pipelines. Whether you’re compressing files, downloading data, or processing images, `parallel` is one of those underrated Linux commands that can make your work noticeably faster with almost no extra effort.
