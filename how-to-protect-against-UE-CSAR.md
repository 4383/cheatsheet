### Cheatsheet: Protecting Open Source & Digital Freedom

This cheatsheet provides practical steps and conceptual frameworks for developers and users to safeguard open source projects and digital privacy, based on the principles of sovereignty and sustainability.

#### The Challenge: Mandated Surveillance

The EU's Chat Control/CSAR regulation aims to force communication services, including open source projects, to integrate surveillance mechanisms into private communications. This undermines user privacy, developer autonomy, and the core values of the open source ecosystem.

### 1. Take Back Control as a User

The first step against mass surveillance is to choose platforms that prioritize freedom and privacy.

**Action: Use Independent App Stores**

Shift away from centralized, controlled app ecosystems. Stores like F-Droid offer free and open source applications that are vetted for security and privacy, free from the tracking and control mechanisms often found in mainstream stores.

```bash
# CONCEPT: Add a trusted, independent software repository like F-Droid.
# This command is illustrative. See the official F-Droid site for actual installation steps.
add-repository --uri "https://f-droid.org/repo" --name "F-Droid"

# CONCEPT: Install a private messenger from the independent repository.
pkg --repo F-Droid install PrivateMessenger
```
*   **Explanation**: Using an independent repository gives you access to software that respects your freedom and hasn't been compromised by commercial or governmental interests.

### 2. Fortify Your Open Source Project

To keep open source a tool of empowerment, projects must be built on a foundation of sovereign governance and financial independence.

**Action: Define a Sovereign Governance Manifesto**

Codify your project's commitment to user freedom. A public manifesto ensures your community and contributors are aligned on core principles, making the project resistant to external pressure.

Create a `GOVERNANCE.md` file in your repository:
```markdown
# --- Project Sovereign Governance Manifesto ---

# 1. User Freedom First: This project will never compromise on user privacy or
#    freedom of speech. We reject any mandated surveillance mechanisms.

# 2. Community-Driven Code: All code merged into the main branch must be
#    reviewed and approved by the core community, not by external mandates.

# 3. Empowerment Over Control: We are committed to building a tool of
#    empowerment, not an instrument of control. Our mission is to enhance
#    user sovereignty.

# 4. Transparency: All development, governance, and decision-making
#    processes are public and transparent to our community.
```
*   **Explanation**: This document acts as a constitution for your project, protecting it from governance attacks and ensuring it stays true to its mission.

**Action: Build a Sustainable & Independent Business Model**

The script emphasizes that true freedom for open source relies on entrepreneurship, not political decisions. A sustainable business model ensures the project can operate and grow without compromising its values.

Create a `BUSINESS_MODEL.md` to outline your strategy:
```yaml
# --- Independent & Sustainable FOSS Business Model ---
# Goal: Achieve financial sustainability while preserving core open source values.

primary_revenue_streams:
  - "Pro-tier features (optional, non-essential)"
  - "Priority support contracts for businesses"
  - "Managed hosting / SaaS version"
  - "Community donations (Patreon, OpenCollective)"
  - "Educational content and paid workshops"

rejected_models:
  - "Selling or monetizing user data"
  - "Ad-based revenue that compromises privacy"
  - "External funding that requires code compromises or backdoors"
```
*   **Explanation**: By focusing on value-aligned revenue streams, you can fund your project's development and ensure its long-term independence from forces that would undermine its mission.

### My Mission

My mission is to help open source creators sustain their projects, both technically and financially. More specifically, it involves helping those who want to make open source a solid development and business model, while preserving its core values. This involves supporting open source entrepreneurs so they can build solid business models that remain true to their values while generating predictable and sustainable revenue. My goal is to help them transform open source into a commercial success, build solid business models, and create solutions that captivate users. I also strive to help those who want to build a real business with open source, while respecting the standards that make it so powerful.
